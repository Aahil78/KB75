# June 12th: The beginning of a new project......

Today I took the first steps of this project, I made the layout in KLE (Haven't tried Ergogen yet) and started with the schematic, most of the time was spent in making the layout so I didn't do much in the schematic, like I was only able to make a few sheets and add in a Pi Pico. I also decided the features and hardware to use.
I decided:
- Hardware:
    - Raspberry Pi Pico or Orpheus Pico.
    - MX-Style Hotswap Sockets.
    - SK6812MINI-E RGB LEDs and all the stuff for that like decoupling capacitors and logic level shifter.
    - EC11 Rotary Encoder with switch.
    - If GPIO isn't enough, I'll need to add in an MCP23017.
    - Maybe Type-C PD will be added so all the ICs and port for that.
    - The rest will be decided as we go on
- Features:
    - Hotswappable MX Switches
    - A rotary encoder
    - Per-key RGB
    - Customizable firmware
    - Compact board (hopefully)

 And that's all that I did today; KLE, Planning, A little bit of the schematic.
